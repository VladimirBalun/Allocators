/*! 
 * \brief Linear allocator implementation.
 * 
 * This is the simplest kind of allocator. The idea is to keep a pointer at the first 
 * memory address of your memory area and move it every time an allocation is done. 
 * In this allocator, the internal fragmentation is kept to a minimum because all elements 
 * are sequentially (spatial locality) inserted and the only fragmentation between them 
 * is the alignment(that can be disabled).
 * 
 * Complexity:
 *  - allocation: O(1)
 *  - free:       absent in this allocator, all memory is freed together.
 *  - clean:      O(1)
 *  
 *  If the 'LA_WITH_ZEROING' was defined, then linear allocator will use 
 *  zeroing of the unused memory(useful for debugging).
